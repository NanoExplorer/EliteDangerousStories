Ok now take that relic up to the strange half domed portion
of the ruins here (possibly include exact lat/lon of relic
recepticle), there should be a glowing light where there
wasn't before coming out of the ground infront of this, park
yourself on top of it and eject that relic from your cargo,
the new hole in the ground will do its job and pull that
relic in, and boom, you've activated a millennias old data
bank... imagine what they could have done with all that time
to miniturize this whole thing ehh?  Get a scan off on that
blue light show there in front of you before the juice runs
out on that battery, otherwise you've wasted a bit of time
here.
