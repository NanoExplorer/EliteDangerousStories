A 3rd party mission-giving service based on EDMC

Hello there! I have been working with Commander Larzok to design a plugin for EDMC that will respond to in-game events to guide commanders through custom-built missions! We hope that this will help fill the percieved lack of in-game mission diversity by allowing anyone to write a mission that other commanders can take! 

Larzok wrote and I implemented a sample mission that guides a commander through the process of obtaining class 4 Corrosion Resistant Cargo Racks from a tech broker. I am including a video of me completing this mission below!

Unfortunately, due to the fact that this is a 3rd party application, these custom missions will only be available to users who are playing Elite on PC. 

This current version includes the following 'sample' missions written by Commander Larzok:
Walkthrough of unlocking grade 4 Corrosion Resistant Cargo Racks
Walkthrough of unlocking Enzyme missile rack
Walkthrough of unlocking Guardian FSD booster

Each mission is designed to add a level of writing and universe-building to the game that has been previously unavailable.

This system is designed with the intent of allowing custom missions to be developed relatively easily. You can view the source code on GitHub <link>
